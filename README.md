This project is a desktop graphical calculator application developed using the Qt framework. It supports basic mathematical expression input and evaluation, with error detection for division by zero and invalid inputs. Users can input numbers and basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) through buttons. The calculator supports parentheses for grouping and correctly handles operator precedence. The result is displayed when the "=" button is pressed.
